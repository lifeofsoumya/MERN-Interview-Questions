### AdmitKard 7-10LPA
1️⃣ First round (cleared)

- var vs let,
- hoisting,
- closure,
- named vs self functions,
- generator functions,
- promises, vs to asynchronous modification, 
- Event loop + JS working process,
- 2-3 tricky mongo Query(find second oldest student),
- setTimeout tricky question + how to fix (with closures),
- IIFE

2️⃣ Second round (70%)

- My projects related (interested in socket.io events)
- Authentication vs Authorization + Implement,
- My AWS S3 bucket usage basics,
- I had to elaborate my Keyhasher npm package basics,
- Modified binary search based DSA,
- implement stack with arr, and find max without loop DSA with JS,
- Hoisting,
- Closures,
- Shallow copy, deep copy (spread op can't do deep copy, how to do it manually),
- using Object.entries clone nested obj to nested arr (I mentioned Object.entries in prev qs),
- Typescript basics + pros and cons
- React lifecycle in both class and function based
- Prototype (Implement a custom function on Array using prototype)

❌ Missed:

- Prototype implementation (theoretically explained)
- Custom stack implementation asked to do in C++, couldn't do in JS
- 0(1) in modified BS
- spread op {... obj} only copies first level key values (swallow), missed there

Feedback:
- You have good knowledge, practice more in depth
